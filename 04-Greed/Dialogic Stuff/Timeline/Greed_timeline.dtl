[You find yourself in a field of gold coins. There must be millions to billions of gold coins surrounding you.]
There are people around you. They look on the brink of death, wearing torn and dirt covered clothing. They kneel on the ground collecting gold coins and putting them into bags. Each bag has a giant hole in it. They don't seem to care.
