Heavy smoke fills your lungs more than the usual amount for Hell. The sound of hundreds of voices fills your head. Through the smoke you can see several groups of people. Each group having something unique about them.
You watch as a man in green plays cards with a man in purple. Suddenly the man in purple jumps up in celebration, soon after all the people wearing green clothes are wearing purple. They had been assimilated into the purple group.
If you are going to be the most powerful here you have to be the best at Heresy. You'll need to play cards and assimilate as many people as possible into your own cult. You already have a deck of cards in your pocket.
